## üí° Why This Project?

LeetCode is great, but:
- It doesn't let you explore all problems offline.
- You can't easily integrate your own DB engine.
- You can't save your answers locally unless you pay for premium.

This repo fixes that by giving you full access to the problems and answers, so you can build your own practice tools or just learn offline.

## ‚ú® What‚Äôs Included?

- 50 real SQL interview-style problems.
- Description, example data, and expected outputs.
- Verified solutions for each.
- Structured text files that are easy to parse.
- Beginner-friendly format.

## ü§ù Contributing.

Pull requests are welcome!

Want to help?
- Turn the data into JSON or CSV.
- Create table creation scripts.
- Build a UI to test user queries.
- Add PostgreSQL or SQLite test cases.

Just fork and PR!
